# Introduction

Welcome to **Topos Docs**, the official documentation to help you get familiar with Topos **Cross-Subnet Protocol (XSP)** and join the network!

## Why Topos XSP?

Today's Web2.0 Internet remains a network of highly centralized computers and services managed by a handful of big tech companies. Concerns from users about how their data is handled and to which extent it is controlled and owned by such companies are getting stronger every day.

Blockchain has paved the way for Web3.0, a new era of distributed and decentralized web services that give back the control to application users. Yet, more than a decade later, the promised revolution hasn't landed. Facing scalability, interoperability and privacy issues, the blockchain technology hasn't been able to proceed to its full industrial adoption and still resides within the scope of experimentation and small-scale production deployment.

**Topos XSP aims at giving back the control and freedom to service users and to lead the way for a true open and decentralized Internet.**
